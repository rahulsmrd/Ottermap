# Ottermap
### What are all the things that we can do through this Website …
1. We can add a shop with the ‘LATITUDE’ and ‘LONGITUDE’ data
2. Customers can see their nearby shops, given their ‘LATITUDE’ and ‘LONGITUDE’.

**Note**: I have provided a link to get latitude and longitude data from an external website (referred out [here](https://www.latlong.net/))
## Tech Stack Used:
1.	Python
2.	Django
3.	DRF
4.	HTML
5.	CSS
   
# APIs:
1.	Create Shop API
   -	Endpoint /shops/v1/CreateShopAPI/
2.	Get Shops API
   -	Endpoint /shops/v1/GetShopAPI/
   -	
I have given two more views to assign the template and make the functionality smooth. I have used APIs to validate data and store it in the database.

All the APIs are made folder here [APIs](https://www.postman.com/dyord2/workspace/ottermap/collection/32082835-dcf7d68a-78c0-4f77-8dbc-c729deaac2a1?action=share&creator=32082835)
